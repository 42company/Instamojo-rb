#Instamojo-rb#

This is the *Ruby* library of [Instamojo API](http://instamojo.com/developers).   
This will assist you to programmatically create, edit and delete offers on Instamojo.

##Status##
This gem is **currently under construction**. Most of the work was over on stretching one weekend.    
Because of some unsolved `SSL` errors, this gem is currently **not fit for installation/use**.   

If you are a fellow Ruby developer and interested in development, please contact.
Expecting to release functional version soon. :)


##Contribution##

* Fork the project
* `bundle install` to satisfy gem dependencies.
* `rake install` to install the gem. 
* Swim around in `lib/`.
